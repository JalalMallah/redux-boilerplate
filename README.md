# Redux Boilerplate ðŸš€

> This is a basic Redux boilerplate created by myself for future reference. I personally prefer to keep all the redux-related files and folders (store, actions, reducers) together in a single folder called 'redux' inside the 'src' folder. This way the 'src' folder remains neat and unbloated. The store includes an implemented redux dev tools enhancer so that it's possible to use the redux browser extension out-of-the-box. The boilerplate also includes some very simple and basic global CSS styling.
